                                    <p class="card-text"> Hey there. My Name is Christopher Coon and welcome to my page! I am a young professional living in downtown Sacramento. Currently, I work for as a Content Moderator for Sony Interactive Entertainment, where I review content for my client, and decide whether it fits into the terms and guidelines provided. I enjoy my job very much, and it allows me to be living exactly how I want to be! I am also going to UC Davis studying Web Development, pursuing my dream of working in the tech industry.
                                    </p>

                                <small>
                                    <p class="card-text"> My interest have always been diverse, from skating and reading to music and concerts. From video games and crafts, to cooking and photography. I like a little bit of everything! I would say my main passion nowadays is writing music, and getting better at riding my electric skateboard. I love learning about new subjects and hearing people talk passionately about them.
                                    </p>

                                    <p class="card-text"> I have had a pretty wild life, whhere I have been all around the country. I was born in New York City and grew up upstate for a while. Then moved to California a few years later, staying primarily in the Sacramento area. Eventually, my family moved to the Dominican Republic in 2010, to assist in volunteer work after the earthquake affected the neighbouring countries. We lived there for 7 years and it was such an amazing experience, and I truly believe it helped shape me into the person I am today! </p>
